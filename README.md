# teufort_parrallaxd

Current version :
Beta 1.1.3

A future project where i'll parallax the landmarks of teufort from the 2007 hit multiplayer game Team Fortress 2.
Parrallaxd parallaxes with the mouse or with a phone gyroscope. This way all users can experience the true parallax experience.

Documentation page about how to import the effect of the parrallaxd to your own website coming soon.

I am currently (2023 / 06 / 06) a little busy but I, one day, will work on this again.

Made for SAE 4.02, MMI AngoulÃªme.

# "I wanna use it"

I do NOT recommand right now. I will take my time making it adaptable for you, and my code requires optimization.
If you think you can do a better job, do it, if you think you can't, then wait for a better option.
There might be a better option already.

That being said, I will still include the code to get it up and running :

Code to add to your HTML

    <section id="parrallaxd" class="fullContainer standBy">
        <div id="background" class="layer-0"></div>
        <div id="item-1" class="item layer-1">
          <img src="./assets/maps/ctf_2fort/deck1.png" class="bridge" />
        </div>
        <div id="item-2" class="item layer-2">
          <img src="./assets/maps/ctf_2fort/bridge.png" class="blubuilding" />
        </div>
        <div id="item-3" class="item layer-3">
          <img src="./assets/maps/ctf_2fort/redfort.png" class="bridge" />
        </div>
      </section>
